# Documentation

Instead of including documentation in this readme file, I took the liberty of using compodoc

[compoc documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/daniel-alonso-sanchez/angular-dalonso-test-/blob/master/src/documentation/index.html)
```
npm install -g @compodoc/compodoc

```

And then, inside $project/src folder

```
compodoc -p ..\tsconfig.json -s

```
